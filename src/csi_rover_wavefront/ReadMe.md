## CSI Rover Wavefront Algo

This is a work in progess. At the moment, the algorithim is complete, but it is not integrated with our other code. 
Thus, it will build but will not be launched when we start our simulation.

### Brief Summary

The froniter alogrithm is an exploration algorithim that aims to explore the entirety of a given space. 
Wavefront is a modification of the classic frontier algorithm that is much less computationally expensive based on 
its conservative use of the provided occupancy grid.
